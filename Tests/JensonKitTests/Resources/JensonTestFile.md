> This is the start of the Jenson file, which contains various elements.

Freddy shudders as he hears the tape. No, it couldn't have been... She had been claimed "dead" for several years.

Witness: "... and he scoffed at me."  
Witness: "Told me that I'd be lucky to experience real life."  
Witness: "To witness for myself a star at dawn..."  

He couldn't bear to listen to the rest of the tape, be he persisted. "In the Hall of the Mountain King" kept playing in the background, the instruments growing louder.

Witness: "... a bubble in a stream..."  

Gregory: "Come on! We only have a few minutes before the gate closes!"

Freddy winces.

Witness: "... a flash of lightning in a summer cloud..."

A panel flashes on the screen with the dreaded line puzzle. He couldn't muster the courage to face it.

- Should he try to solve it?
  - Solve it
    - He sighs and starts tracing, his robotic finger quavering.
  - Leave it be
    - Freddy: "No..."
    - He couldn't do it. He turns away as the tape continues to play.

Witness: "... a flickering lamp.."  

The door unexpectedly closes, and a scream is heard from another room.

Witness: "... a phantom, and a dream..."

The tape clicks. It had been done.

> End of Jenson file.
